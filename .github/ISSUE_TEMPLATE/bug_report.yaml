        ### How to write a good bug report?

        - Respect the issue template as much as possible.
        - The title should be short and descriptive.
        - Explain the conditions which led you to report this issue and the context.
        - The context should lead to something, an idea or a problem that you‚Äôre facing.
        - Remain clear and concise.
        - Format your messages to help the reader focus on what matters and understand the structure of your message, use [Markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)
