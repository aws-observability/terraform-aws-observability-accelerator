# Amazon ECS on EC2 cluster monitoring

This example demonstrates how to monitor your Amazon Elastic Container Service on EC2
(Amazon ECS) cluster with the Observability Accelerator's
[ECS monitoring module](https://github.com/aws-observability/terraform-aws-observability-accelerator/tree/main/modules/ecs-monitoring).

The module collects Prometheus metrics from tasks running on ECS and sends it to Prometheus using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (ADOT).
You can either run the collector as a sidecar or deploy the collector as its own ECS service for entire cluster.
ECS tasks with Prometheus endpoints are discovered using extension
[ecsobserver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/extension/observer/ecsobserver/README.md).
(Unlike EKS, there is no builtin discovery for ECS inside prometheus)

Additionally, you can optionally collect custom Prometheus metrics from your applications running
on your ECS cluster.

## Prerequisites

!!! note
    Make sure to complete the [prerequisites section](https://aws-observability.github.io/terraform-aws-observability-accelerator/concepts/#prerequisites) before proceeding.

## Available Samples for various Worklods
Make sure to update your exisitng Application Task Definitions based on the workload type :-

#### 1. [Java/JMX workload for ECS Clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Sample-Workloads-ECS-javajmx.html)
#### 2. [NGINX workload for Amazon ECS clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Setup-nginx-ecs.html)
#### 3. [App Mesh workload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Sample-Workloads-ECS-appmesh.html)

## Setup

#### 1. Add the ECS Monitoring Module to your exisitng ECS CLuster

```
module "ecs_monitoring" {
  source                = "../../modules/ecs-monitoring"
  aws_ecs_cluster_name  = module.ecs_cluster.cluster_name
  task_role_arn           = module.ecs_cluster.task_exec_iam_role_arn
  execution_role_arn      = module.ecs_cluster.task_exec_iam_role_arn

  depends_on = [
    module.ecs_cluster
  ]
}
```

## Deploy

Simply run this command to deploy the example

```bash
terraform apply
```

## Cleanup

To clean up your environment, destroy the Terraform example by running

```sh
terraform destroy
```
